# Dog and Cat Image Classification

A machine learning project to classify images as either a dog or a cat using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow/Keras.

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to classify images of dogs and cats using deep learning techniques. A CNN is trained on a dataset containing labeled images to achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a given image is a dog or a cat.

## Features
- Image preprocessing with data augmentation
- Binary classification of dog and cat images
- Visualization of training and validation accuracy
- Real-time predictions on new images

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ghdbashen/Image-Classification-Cat-and-Dog.git
   cd dog-cat-classification
